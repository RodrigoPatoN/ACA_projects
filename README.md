## Project 1 (TP1):

#### Objective

This project aims to develop a supervised image classification model for skin lesion diagnosis using the DermaMNIST dataset. The goal is to compare different neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Various configurations will be tested by modifying:

Network depth and layer structures

Loss functions (MultiMarginLoss, Cross Entropy)

Optimizers (RMSprop, ADAM)

Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, dropout, regularization)

Performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to determine the most effective approach for classifying skin diseases.

#### Dataset

10,015 skin lesion images (3 × 28 × 28)

7 disease categories

Split: 70% Train, 10% Validation, 20% Test
